# CTR Cortex

CTR Cortex is an intelligence engine that observes how crypto market narratives form, spread, and fade over time.

It does not predict prices or execute trades.
Instead, it focuses on understanding **attention, confidence, and narrative momentum** across public sources like news, forums, and media platforms.

The long-term value of Cortex comes from preserving clean, explainable historical judgments that compound over time.

## Why It Exists
Crypto markets often move on stories before numbers.
Cortex is designed to capture those stories early and track how they evolve.

## High-Level Flow
- Ingest raw public data
- Normalise and clean signals
- Score narrative strength and confidence
- Store results in a long-lived database
- Improve logic without rewriting history

## Status
Early build. Focused on clean data ingestion, schema discipline, and long-term integrity.
